# About

I am from Barcelona and I have a **Materials Science and Engineering MEng** degree from the University of Sheffield. I am currently doing a PhD in Computational Chemistry at the University of Southampton.

I am passionate about programming. I have tried to learn as much as I can in my free time and I have done some projects that you can check out in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Parzival1918) profile.

>    I am most proficient in Python but I have coded in other languages too (I really like Rust!) and I can pick up the basics of any coding language pretty quickly.
