<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="mb-0 pb-4">Hello! I'm Pedro Juan Royo, a PhD student in Computational Chemistry at the Day Group in Southampton (UK). I hold a Master of Engineering in Materials Science & Engineering. My research focuses on using the Monte Carlo threshold algorithm to explore the crystal packing energy landscapes of molecular crystals, and see how we can use this information in a crystal structure prediction workflow.</p>
