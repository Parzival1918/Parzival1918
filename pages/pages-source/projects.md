## REST APIs

I built some REST APIs using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) in python:

- **Bricoheroes API**: Search information about all the [Bricoheroes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHF437Sz2MHoR-3YNtdCX7opSo93wqlGq) episodes from Youtube.

- **El Búnquer API**: Search information about all published [El Búnquer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5HwsHboiE9ngozgQ1ZkB9X4gnEwUcLR3) episodes from Youtube, it updates the database as the episodes are published! 

They were hosted in *deta space*, but it closed late in 2024 so now they are not working but the code is available in GitHub.
