Heyo, this is my website! It has a record of everything worth recording that I've done, which is not much for now but hopefully that will change soon 🤡.

Some random facts about me (in no particular order):

- I like to code but I am not too good at it.
- I do not see the point in anyone ever using Windows as an operating system. Too bad not all apps can run on Linux...
- I love cats 😼.
- I live to eat, not the other way around. I'm very proud of my lump free bechamel 🤤!
- I love CLI and TUI programs and try to do as many things as possible in them (I am writing this document using the *Helix* editor, *Zellij* as a terminal multiplexer and I listen to music using *termusic*).
- Tiling window managers rule! (i3wm for the win 😁)
- I have watched *The Office (US)* more than 10 times, and this number can only go up 😎.
