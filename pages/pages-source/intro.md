# Pedro Juan Royo's website

```{important}

I'm Catalan (unfortunately Spanish too 🙁) and in there we have two surnames. The first one is my dad's first surname and my second one is my mom's first surname. 

Therefore, Juan is not my middle name. My two surnames are **Juan** and **Royo**.

I just wanted to say this first. Since I moved to UK to go to uni I have hadquite a few brits asking is Juan is my middle name, and it is something I had never really thought about until I left Barcelona.

Also, what is it with people marrying and the bride taking the groom's surname? That is weird. The way we do it is better and more respectful of echothers past.

Heyo, this is my website! It has a record of everything worth recording that I've done, which is not much for now but hopefully that will change soon 🤡.

Some random info about me (in no particular order):

- I like to code but I am not too good at it.
- I do not see the point in anyone ever using Windows as an operating system. Too bad not all apps can run on Linux...
- I love cats 😼.
- I live to eat, not the other way around. I'm very proud of my lump free bechamel 🤤!
- I love CLI and TUI programs and try to do as many things as possible in them (I am writing this document using the *Helix* editor, *Zellij* as a terminal multiplexer and I listen to music using *termusic*).
- Tiling window managers rule! (i3wm for the win 😁)
- I have watched *The Office (US)* more than 10 times, and this number can only go up 😎.
