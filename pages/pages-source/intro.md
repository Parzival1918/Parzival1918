# Pedro Juan Royo's website

```{warning} A very important note 🔪

I'm Catalan (unfortunately Spanish too 🙁) and in there we have two surnames. The first one is my dad's first surname and my second one is my mom's first surname. 

Therefore, Juan is not my middle name. My two surnames are **Juan** and **Royo**.

I just wanted to say this first. Since I moved to UK to go to uni I have hadquite a few brits asking is Juan is my middle name, and it is something I had never really thought about until I left Barcelona.

Also, what is it with people marrying and the bride taking the groom's surname? That is weird.

Heyo, this is my website! It has a record of everything worth recording that I've done, which is not much for now but hopefully that will change soon 🤡.
