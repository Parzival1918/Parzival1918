# About me

I am from Barcelona and I have a *Materials Science and Engineering MEng* degree from the University of Sheffield. I am currently doing a PhD in Computational Chemistry at the University of Southampton.

I am passionate about programming. I have tried to learn as much as I can in my free time and I have done some projects that you can check out in the [Projects](./projects.md) section and my [GitHub](https://github.com/Parzival1918).

- I am most proficient in Python but I have coded in other languages too (I really like Rust!) and I can pick up the basics of any coding language pretty quickly.

I really like *cooking*, and it looks like my star recipe is quiche.
